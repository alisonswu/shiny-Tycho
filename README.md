# Project Tycho Data Explorer 

Shiny_Tycho is a Shiny app for visualizing large public health data from levels L1, L2, L3 of [Project Tycho](https://www.tycho.pitt.edu). The app utilizes Shiny and Plotly to create different types of interactive plots for exploring spatial and temporal trends in the data. I also created another [app](https://github.com/alisonswu/shiny-Tycho_L1L2) for exploring the data at L1 and L2 level at fine granularity. Â 

## Screenshots
